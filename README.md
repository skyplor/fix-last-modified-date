## Background
There is currently an issue of files' last modified date being changed to the current date when transferred from laptop to the Android phone.

## Description
This is an Android project that attempts to allow user to select a WhatsApp image to fix the last modified date of that image. 

## Disclaimer
The file.setLastModified() method is used in this project but apparently it has some issue changing the date. So this project has been left as-is. Until the issue has been fixed from Google's side.
